# Examples

Here are good examples and working code snippets to start from.

A lot of these files are used for development and are subject to change.

For more complete sample code, see the integration testing suite in `/test`.

### Running the examples

Run the examples. Make sure to pass both the file you wish to run, as well as `common.go` to include the convenience functions.

```bash
go run photo.go common.go # Run the photo example
go run login.go common.go # Run the login example
```
